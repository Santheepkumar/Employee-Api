# Employee-Api

1. npm install
2. Start the server (node index.js) or use nodemon
   Server will start on Port - 7000
3.Send a post request to (localhost:7000/api/Employee)
  with keys:  name, gender, dop, employeestatus
     Example:  name = Santheep
               gender = male
               dop = 05/10/1998
               employeestatus = Active
             
4.Send a get request to the same url (localhost:7000/api/Employee)

It will give all the Employee data with randomly generated EmployeeID
  
  
     Thankyou for the opportunity sir
